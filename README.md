# Space-Station-and-Weather-tracker-application

This application provides real-time tracking of the International Space Station (ISS) and displays the current weather at its location. It retrieves data from two APIs: "etheiss.at" for tracking the ISS and "enweathermap.org" for weather updates. The data from these APIs is converted into JSON format for use within the application. It features a dynamic map that visually represents the movement and precise location of the ISS. Additionally, it displays the weather conditions at the ISS's current location, offering a unique integration of space tracking and meteorological data. This allows users to visually follow the ISS as it orbits the Earth, along with instant weather updates for its immediate vicinity.
